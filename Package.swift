import PackageDescription
import Foundation

// Shared package for Desert Ant Labs' on-device model SDKs.
//
// The wasm backends need JavaScriptKit, which pulls swift-syntax (macros). A
// package dependency cannot carry a platform condition -- only the *product*
// dependencies below can -- so declaring it unconditionally makes every consumer
// (iOS, macOS, Linux, Android) clone JavaScriptKit + swift-syntax and build the
// host macro plugins, for code that is entirely `#if os(WASI)`. It also breaks
// Android's static-stdlib link, where host macros conflict with `-resource-dir`.
//
// So JavaScriptKit is opt-in: only a build that actually targets wasm sets
// DAL_WASM_BUILD=1, which is `mise run test:wasi` and `mise run build:wasm`.
// A wasm task that forgets it fails with "no product named
// 'EmoWeb'", because the *Web products below are declared with it. Everyone else
// resolves a graph without it. SWIFT_ANDROID_STATIC_BUILD stays honoured as a
// hard opt-out so an Android build can never pick it up by accident.
//
// `Package.resolved` differs between the two modes (SwiftPM prunes unused pins),
// which is why it stays gitignored -- switching modes just re-resolves.

let wasmBuild = ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["DAL_WASM_BUILD"] != nil

// MLX is opt-in for the same reason, and the reason is the same MACRO problem — but unlike
// JavaScriptKit it is gated by a package TRAIT rather than an environment variable.
//
// `Title` is the one model here that does not run through `InferenceSession`: writing a title
// is short autoregressive decode, which measured 5.7-8.3x faster on MLX/GPU than on the ANE,
// and `8e97532` removed MLState when the Core ML path lost. So Title needs mlx-swift-lm.
//
// `MLXHuggingFace` exposes `#huggingFaceLoadModelContainer`, a MACRO — so it pulls swift-syntax
// and host macro plugins exactly as JavaScriptKit does, and a package dependency cannot carry a
// platform condition. Declaring its target edges unconditionally would make every Linux and
// Android consumer clone and build it for a target MLX cannot run on at all, and would risk the
// same static-stdlib link conflict recorded above.
//
// So: the `MLX` trait (SE-0450). SwiftPM PRUNES the mlx-swift-lm and swift-transformers
// package dependencies whenever no enabled trait references them, so a consumer without the
// trait never clones them — the same graph the old `DAL_MLX_BUILD` env var produced, but
// declared in the consumer's manifest instead of ambient process environment (which Xcode's
// resolver could only see via `launchctl setenv`).
//
// The trait is deliberately NOT a default trait: default traits are enabled implicitly by
// every consumer, including the Linux/Android/wasm pipelines, which would then need
// `--disable-default-traits` plumbed through every build (including plugin invocations that
// may not forward trait flags). Opt-in keeps every non-Apple graph exactly as before.
//
// A consumer opts in with:  .package(url: ..., traits: ["MLX"])   (tools-version 6.1+)
// and a build that forgets it fails compiling against the `Title` stub (its MLX API is behind
// `#if MLX`) rather than mis-building.
//
// The env var check stays temporarily as a migration guard: a build still exporting
// DAL_MLX_BUILD gets a loud error instead of silently building a Title stub.

// Xet is opt-in for the graph reason above, not the macro one: swift-xet is pure Swift with no

// make every Linux, Android and wasm build clone and resolve the NIO stack for a transport only
// Apple platforms ever construct (and Android's static-stdlib link has no appetite for NIO's C

    // dragging every other model up with them:
    //
    //   Clips  iOS 18 / macOS 15 / tvOS 18 / visionOS 2. `clips.mlmodelc` is a MULTIFUNCTION
    //          package and multifunction is an iOS 18 feature. Read off the compiled artifact:
    //          specificationVersion 9. iOS 17 was measured, not assumed: the graph converts at
    //          spec 8, but two fixed-shape packages cost 562 MB against 284, and one
    //          enumerated-shape package cannot use the Neural Engine and ran ~20x slower
    //          (833 ms/batch at 128 against 40 ms).
    //   Title  iOS 17 / macOS 14, MLX's own floor.
    //
    // An earlier version of this branch raised the whole package to iOS 17, then to iOS 18, on
    // the reasoning that "SwiftPM platform floors are package-wide". That is true of THIS
    // declaration and false of the thing that matters: `@available` is per-declaration, so a
    // model that needs a newer OS can say so without costing the models that do not.
    //
    // The one case where the package floor genuinely must move is MLX, because a DEPENDENCY's
    // platform requirement is a manifest-level constraint that `@available` cannot satisfy:
    // SwiftPM refuses to resolve `MLXLLM` (macOS 14) into a macOS 13 package. The floor used
    // to rise only behind `DAL_MLX_BUILD`; `platforms` cannot vary by trait, so with the `MLX`
    // trait the iOS 17 / macOS 14 floor is now unconditional. That costs iOS 16 / macOS 13 for
    // Apple consumers that never enable MLX — accepted deliberately: no known Apple consumer
    // sits below iOS 17, and Linux/Android/wasm ignore Apple floors entirely. If such a
    // consumer appears, this is the line to argue about.
